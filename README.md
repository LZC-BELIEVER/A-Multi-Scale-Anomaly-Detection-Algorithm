# A Multi-Scale Anomaly Detection Algorithm (AICE 2025)

**Design of a Multi-Scale Flight Parameter Data Anomaly Detection Algorithm**
[[Paper]](paper/paper.pdf)


- The project is based on [DCdetector](https://github.com/DAMO-DI-ML/KDD2023-DCdetector).
- The DCdetector model excels at detecting long-duration anomalies in flight parameter data but performs poorly with short-duration anomalies. To address this limitation, we develop two improved multi-scale variants: a segmentation model that processes different temporal scales separately and a concatenation model that integrates cross-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that both enhanced models successfully identify short anomalies while maintaining the original model's strong performance on long-duration anomaly detection.

## Architecture

- **Multi-scale segmentation model**: Fig 1 presents the architecture of our multi-scale segmentation model based on DCdetector. The key innovation is a multi-scale feature extraction mechanism where input time-series data undergoes multi-scale downsampling through varying pooling windows, generating subsequences at different temporal resolutions, enabling simultaneous capture of macro trends and micro anomalies.

- **Multi-scale concatenation model**: The enhanced multi-scale concatenation model (Fig. 2) extends the segmentation model by introducing cross-scale feature fusion. After multi-scale decomposition and dual-branch feature extraction, it concatenates all scale features with original representations for joint processing through dual-attention and difference representation modules.

## Experiments 
- The DCdetector model demonstrates strong performance in detecting long-duration anomalies in flight data but fails to identify short-duration anomalies, as shown across multiple datasets. Table â…  presents the model's detection performance on unmodified UCR, UCR_AUG and MSL datasets, where average precision and recall rates represent means across all test sequences.

- The multi-scale partitioning model greatly improves short anomaly detection. Fig. 3 compares results between the original DCdetector (without multi-scale pooling) and the multi-scale partitioning model on the UCR_1 dataset, and Fig. 4 illustrates the detection results under varying pooling scale combinations.

- Comparative experiments (Fig. 5) evaluate the multi-scale concatenation model against the partitioning model and original DCdetector on UCR_1 across varying anomaly lengths. Fig. 6 shows performance varying scale combinations.
